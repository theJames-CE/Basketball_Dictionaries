<h1>Basketball Dictionaries</h1>

<b>Learning Objectives:</b>

<li>Students will update a class constructor to accept a single dictionary of data, rather than many arguments.</li><br>
<li>Students will use dictionary data to create an object instance</li><br>
<li>Students will populate a list of object instances from a list of dictionaries</li><br>
<li>Students will write a class method that populates a list of object instances from a list of dictionaries</li><br>

The lists look something like this:

<h2>Assignment Tasks</h2>

<h3>Challenge 1: Update the Constructor</h3>

His class constructor so far looks like this:

<li>Update the constructor to accept a dictionary with a single player's information instead of individual arguments for the attributes.</li><br>

<h3>Challenge 2: Create instances using individual player dictionaries.</h3>

Given these variables, create <b><i>Player</b></i> instances for each of the following dictionaries. Be sure to instantiate these <i>outside</i> the class definition, in the outer scope.

<h3>Challenge 3: Make a list of Player instances from a list of dictionaries</h3><br>

Finally, given the example <b><i>list</b></i> of players at the top of this module (the one with many players) write a for loop that will populate an empty list with <b><i>Player</b></i> objects from the original list of dictionaries.

<h3>NINJA BONUS: Add a get_team(cls, team_list) @class method</h3><br>

Add an @class method called get_team(cls, team_list) that, given a list of dictionaries populates and returns a new list of Player objects. Be sure to test your method!
